The rational drug design identified as much of the recent discoveries of potent drugs molecule against any targets. This results in an improvement in bindings for better potency and selectivity. The drugs containing ethanolamine/propylamine fragments along with heterocycles have shown potential antiviral results. Similarly, there is the possibility of controlling the COVID-19 infection by nucleotide analogues. Here we also highlight drugs ACEIs/ARBs inhibitory discussing both their advantages and disadvantages. The class of compounds/antibodies inhibiting interleukin-6 works in antirheumatoid drugs are found useful in alleviating overactive inflammatory responses in the lungs of the patient. These inclusion based approaches counter some of the side-effects associated with the heterocycles and also potentiate the efficacy of the molecules. In this review article, design strategies for some of the drugs effective against SARS-CoV-2 are represented. The review also focuses on the listing of drugs that are currently testing under clinical trials for the COVID-19 virus with their mechanism of action. This conversation undertakes the opportunity to do a bit for the newer researchers working in this arena.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The rapidly enlarging COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-corona virus-2 is a global public health emergency of an unprecedented level. Unfortunately no treatment therapy or vaccine is yet available to counter the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which substantiates the need to expand research efforts in this direction. The indispensable function of the main protease in virus replication makes this enzyme a promising target for inhibitors screening and drug discovery to treat novel coronavirus infection. The recently concluded α-ketoamide ligand-bound X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6Y2F) from Zhang et al. has revealed the potential inhibitor binding mechanism and the molecular determinants responsible for substrate binding. METHODS:For the study, we have targeted the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the screening of FDA approved antiviral drugs and carried out molecular docking based virtual screening. Further molecular dynamic simulation studies of the top three selected drugs carried out to investigated for their binding affinity and stability in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site. The phylogenetic analysis was also performed to know the relatedness between the SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from different countries. RESULTS:The phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals that the virus is closely related to the Bat-SL-CoV and does not exhibit any divergence at the genomic level. Molecular docking studies revealed that among the 77 drugs, screened top ten drugs shows good binding affinities, whereas the top three drugs: Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Tipranavir, and Raltegravir were undergone for molecular dynamics simulation studies for their conformational stability in the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein. CONCLUSIONS:In the present study among the library of FDA approved antiviral drugs, the top three inhibitors Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Tipranavir, and Raltegravir show the best molecular interaction with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. However, the in-vitro efficacy of the drug molecules screened in this study further needs to be corroborated by carrying out a biochemical and structural investigation.">

COVID-19 significantly affects multiple systems including the cardiovascular system. Most importantly, in addition to the direct injury from the virus per se, the subsequent cytokine storm, an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds, causes devastating damage. To date, emerging anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments are warranted to control epidemics. Several candidate drugs have been screened and are currently under investigation. These primarily include antiviral regimens and immunomodulatory regimens. However, beyond the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, these drugs may also have risks to the cardiovascular system, especially altering cardiac conduction. Herein, we review the cardiovascular risks of potential anti-COVID-19 drugs.">

Therefore, the repurposing of existing drugs for new indications is needed. In this article, we argue for the potential benefits of using doxycycline with either hydroxycholoroquine or other putative agents for COVID-19 treatment, as doxycycline has antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities by dampening the cytokine storm and to prevent lung damage.">

        <span class="abst" title="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), is a novel human Coronavirus that is responsible for about 300,000 deaths worldwide. To date, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine prevention strategy against COVID-19. Due to the urgent need for effective treatment, drug repurposing is regarded as the immediate option. Potential drugs can often be identified via in silico drug screening experiments. Consequently, there has been an explosion of in silico experiments to find drug candidates or investigate anecdotal claims. One drug with several anecdotal accounts of benefit is Cefuroxime. The aim of this study was to identify and summarize in silico evidence for possible activity of Cefuroxime against SARS-CoV-2.To this end, we performed a scoping review of literature of in silico drug repurposing experiments for SARS-CoV-2 using PRISMA-ScR. We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar for original studies published between 1st Feb, 2020 and 15th May, 2020 that screened drug libraries, and identified Cefuroxime as a top-ranked potential inhibitor drug against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Six studies were identified. These studies reported Cefuroxime as a potential inhibitor of 3 key SARS-CoV-2 proteins; main protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and ACE2-Spike complex. We provided a summary of the methodology and findings of the identified studies. Our scoping review identified significant in silico evidence that Cefuroxime may be a potential multi-target inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to evaluate the potential of Cefuroxime for COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.">

Lack of vaccine or antiviral drug with clinical efficacy suggested that drug repurposing approach may provide a quick therapeutic solution to COVID-19. Nonstructural protein-15 (NSP15) encodes for an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) enzyme, essential for virus life cycle and an attractive target for drug development. We have performed in silico based virtual screening of FDA approved compounds targeting EndoU in search of COVID-19 drugs from commercially available approved molecules. Two drugs Glisoxepide and Idarubicin used for treatment for diabetes and leukemia, respectively, were selected as stronger binder of EndoU. Both the drugs bound to the active site of the viral endonuclease by forming attractive intermolecular interactions with catalytically essential amino acid residues, His235, His250, and Lys290. Molecular dynamics simulation studies showed stable conformation dynamics upon drugs binding to endoU. The binding free energies for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin were calculated to be -141 ± 11 and -136 ± 16 kJ/mol, respectively. The IC50 were predicted to be 9.2 µM and 30 µM for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin, respectively. Comparative structural analysis showed the stronger binding of EndoU to Glisoxepide and Idarubicin than to uridine monophosphate (UMP). Surface area calculations showed buried are of 361.8Å2 by Glisoxepide which is almost double of the area occupied by UMP suggesting stronger binding of the drug than the ribonucleotide. However, further studies on these drugs for evaluation of their clinical efficacy and dose formulations may be required, which may provide a quick therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.

        <span class="abst" title="Nigella sativa or black seed is used as a medicinal plant around the globe. Oil and seeds have a long tradition of folklore use in various medicinal and food systems. The conventional therapeutic use of Nigella sativa, in different ways, has been reported in several studies to treat different diseases including influenza, headache, hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, eczema, fever, cough, asthma, bronchitis, and fever. Based on previously reported potential therapeutic uses of N. sativa compounds, and keeping in mind the dire need of time for the development of potent antiviral, a combined docking, ADMET properties calculation, molecular dynamics, and MM-PBSA approaches were applied in the current study to check the therapeutic potentials of N. sativa chief constituents against COVID-19. Among the studied compounds, we found that dithymoquinone (DTQ), with binding affinity of -8.6 kcal/mol compared to a positive control (chloroquine, -7.2 kcal/mol) , has the high potential of binding at SARS-CoV-2:ACE2 interface and thus could be predicted as a plausible inhibitor to disrupt viral-host interactions. Molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns well complemented binding affinity of the compound and revealed strong stability of DTQ at the docked site. Additionally, MM-PBSA also affirms the docking results. Compound DTQ of the present study, if validated in wet lab experiments, could be used to treat COVID-19 and could serve as a lead in the future for development of more effective natural antivirals against COVID-19.

The virus exerts its pathogenic activity through by mechanism and gains the entry via spike proteins (S) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor proteins on host cells. The present work is an effort for a computational target to block the residual binding protein (RBP) on spike proteins (S), Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor proteins by probiotics namely Plantaricin BN, Plantaricin JLA-9, Plantaricin W, Plantaricin D along with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Docking studies were designed in order to obtain the binding energies for Plantaricin metabolites. The binding energies for Plantaricin W were -14.64, -11.1 and -12.68 for polymerase, RBD and ACE2 respectively comparatively very high with other compounds. Plantaricin W, D, and JLA-9 were able to block the residues (THR556, ALA558) surrounding the deep grove catalytic site (VAL557) of RdRp making them more therapeutically active for COVID-19. Molecular dynamics studies further strengthen stability of the complexes of plantaricin w and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp enzyme, RBD of spike protein, and human ACE2 receptor. The present study present multi-way options either by blocking RBD on S proteins or interaction of S protein with ACE2 receptor proteins or inhibiting RdRp to counter any effect of COVID-19 by Plantaricin molecules paving a way that can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 until some better option will be available.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

        <span class="abst" title="The COVID-19 outbreak has fueled a global demand for effective diagnosis and treatment as well as mitigation of the spread of infection, all through large-scale approaches such as specific alternative antiviral methods and classical disinfection protocols. Based on an abundance of engineered materials identifiable by their useful physicochemical properties through versatile chemical functionalization, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches to cope with this emergency. Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and computational science, we outline how nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored. In this case, nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the pulmonary system to inhibit interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and viral S protein. Moreover, the concept of &quot;nanoimmunity by design&quot; can help us to design materials for immune modulation, either stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in the context of vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 or in counteracting the cytokine storm, respectively. In addition to disease prevention and therapeutic potential, nanotechnology has important roles in diagnostics, with potential to support the development of simple, fast, and cost-effective nanotechnology-based assays to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers. In summary, nanotechnology is critical in counteracting COVID-19 and will be vital when preparing for future pandemics.">

So the objective and purpose of this work was to investigate the plants with reported potential antiviral activity. With the aid of in silico techniques such as molecular docking and druggability studies, we have proposed several natural active compounds including glycyrrhizin, bicylogermecrene, tryptanthrine, β-sitosterol, indirubin, indican, indigo, hesperetin, crysophanic acid, rhein, berberine and β-caryophyllene which can be encountered as potential herbal candidate exhibiting anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Promising docking outcomes have been executed which evidenced the worthy of these selected herbal remedies for future drug development to combat coronavirus disease.">

        <span class="abst" title="SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, is responsible for the current COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2' or 3' modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses' exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3'-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2'-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2'-F-dUTP, 2'-NH2-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronaviruses possess an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2'-OH at the 3'-terminus of the growing RNA strand for proofreading. In this study, all nucleoside triphosphate analogues evaluated form Watson-Crick-like base pairs. The nucleotide analogues demonstrating termination either lack a 2'-OH, have a blocked 2'-OH, or show delayed termination. Thus, these nucleotide analogues are of interest for further investigation to evaluate whether they can evade the viral exonuclease activity. Prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA-approved medications for treatment of other viral infections, and their safety profiles are well established. After demonstrating potency in inhibiting viral replication in cell culture, candidate molecules can be rapidly evaluated as potential therapies for COVID-19.">

METHODS:One hundred and sixty one consecutive severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) were retrospectively reviewed in this multicenter study. Demographic features, medical histories, clinical symptoms, lung computerized tomography (CT) findings, and laboratory indexes on admission were collected. Post-admission complications, treatment regimens, and clinical outcomes were also documented. RESULTS:The mean age was 59.38 ± 16.54 years, with 104 (64.60%) males and 57 (35.40%) females. Hypertension (44 [27.33%]) and diabetes were the most common medical histories. Fever (127 [78.88%]) and dry cough (111 [68.94%]) were the most common symptoms. Blood routine indexes, hepatic and renal function indexes, and inflammation indexes were commonly abnormal. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common post-admission complication (69 [42.86%]), followed by electrolyte disorders (48 [29.81%]), multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) (37 [22.98%]), and hypoproteinemia (36 [22.36%]). The most commonly used antiviral drug was lopinavir/ritonavir tablet. 50 (31.06%) patients died, while 78 (48.45%) patients healed and discharged, and the last 33 (20.50%) patients remained in hospital. Besides, the mean hospital stay of deaths was 21.66 ± 11.18 days, while the mean hospital stay of discharged patients was 18.42 ± 12.77 days. Furthermore, ARDS (P &lt; .001) and MODS (P = .008) correlated with increased mortality rate. CONCLUSION:Severe and critical COVID-19 presents with high mortality rate, and occurrence of ARDS or MODS greatly increases its mortality risk.">

The patients were found to have a novel coronavirus genetically related to a bat coronavirus that was termed SARS-CoV-2. The virus gradually spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by WHO. Scientists have started trials on potential preventive and treatment options. Currently, there is no specific approved treatment for SARS-CoV-2, and various clinical trials are underway to explore better treatments. Some previously approved antiviral and other drugs have shown some in vitro activity. Here we summarize the fight against this novel coronavirus with particular focus on the different treatment options and clinical trials exploring treatment as well as work done toward development of vaccines.">

This is a scoping review, in which all related articles on COVID-19 and the probable benefits of Pentoxifylline against COVID-19 pathogenesis, in Medline, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Google Scholar up to 20 March 2020 with proper keywords including: pentoxifylline, Pentoxil, COVID-19, coronavirus, treatment, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antifibrosis, oxygenation, circulation, bronchodilator, ARDS, and organ failure. We found many confirmatory data on proper efficacy of pentoxifylline on controlling COVID-19 and its consequences. The antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, immune-modulatory, bronchodilator and respiratory supportive effects and protective roles in organ failures of PTX, along with its main functions means better circulation-oxygenation properties, low price and safety, make it a promising drug to be considered for COVID-19 treatment, especially as an adjuvant therapy in combination with other drugs.">

In this Perspective paper, we summarize current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and aging, in order to understand why older people are more affected by COVID-19. We discuss about the possibility that the so-called “immunosenescence” and “inflammaging” processes, already present in a fraction of frail older adults, could allow the immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 serious complications. Finally, we propose to use geroscience approaches to the field of COVID-19.">

WHO has declared this disease as a pandemic, and warned other countries. Presently this has affected 216 countries, areas or territories worldwide, spreading of this disease is very fast in USA, Brazil, and Russia than in the country of its origin, China. Like other coronaviruses, this may develop respiratory tract infections in the patients range from mild to fatal illness like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As of now, no effective drug, vaccine, or any procedure is available and experiments are underway. However, empirical therapy is being followed to manage and save the lives of the patients. There is a need for pharmacological alternatives to combat this deadly virus and its complications. Based on the previous experiences with similar coronavirus management and present preliminary data from uncontrolled studies, drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir have been recommended by the researchers to manage COVID-19. This review had assessed the potential mechanisms, safety profile, availability and cost of these drugs. This review concludes that the drugs mentioned above are having different properties and act differently in combating the COVID-19 viruses. Instead of single drug, combination of antivirals with different mechanism of action may be more effective and at the same time their adverse events should not be underestimated.">

Taking advantage of the cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in the prefusion conformation, we performed a virtual screening simulation with the aim to identify novel molecules that could be used as fusion inhibitors. The spike glycoprotein structure has been completed using modeling techniques and its inner cavity, needful for the postfusion transition of the trimer, has been scanned for the identification of strongly interacting available drugs. Finally, the stability of the protein-drug top complexes has been tested using classical molecular dynamics simulations. The free energy of interaction of the molecules to the spike protein has been evaluated through the MM/GBSA method and per-residue decomposition analysis. Results have been critically discussed considering previous scientific knowledge concerning the selected compounds and sequence alignments have been carried out to evaluate the spike glycoprotein similarity among the betacoronavirus family members. Finally, a cocktail of drugs that may be used as SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors has been suggested.">

This study aims to find a new antiviral combination regimen by investigating the frequency of clinically relevant and objectively identified comorbidities, and the clustering of these clinical syndromes and varying results of treatment with antiviral drugs in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. METHODS:This study recruited 151 severe COVID-19 infection cases diagnosed in our hospital examination and illustrated the clinical potential during a consecutive 25-day medication period. Potential differences in disease severity and clinical characteristics, hematological profile, and current pharmacologic treatments (single agent, double or triple combinations, and the combined antiviral drugs plus Lianhua Qingwen) among comorbidity clusters were explored. RESULTS:Although disease severity was comparable among three clusters, it was markedly different in terms of laboratory test status. Coagulable abnormality was mainly present in cluster 1 and cluster 2. Other indicators were normal, except for a significant increase of neutrophils presented in cluster 2. Patients showed the most complicated haematological results in cluster 3, including severe coagulation abnormalities, leukocytosis, neutrophilic granulocytosis, and lymphopenia. Our results for the first time suggest that a quadruple combination therapy (Ribavirin, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Umifenovir, and Lianhua Qingwen) can be considered as a preferred treatment approach to severe COVID-19 patients. After treatment, abnormal coagulation and leukocyte had markedly improved with a better prognosis. CONCLUSION:This study expands the understanding of the co-occurrence of combination therapy in patients with COVID-19, which provides the probability of developing novel combined therapy. Furthermore, explore clinical trials of variable antivirus treatments based on subgroup analyses or on using subgroups in the selection criteria would be the next step.">

Despite ongoing research toward the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, such a vaccine will not be available in time to contribute to the containment of the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a framework for the rapid identification of novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. We analyzed publicly available transcriptomic datasets of SARS-CoV infected humans and mammals to identify consistent differentially expressed genes then validated in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells transcriptomic datasets. Comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of the identified genes to identify possible interactions with clinically proven drugs was carried out. We identified IFITM3 as an early upregulated gene, and valproic acid was found to enhance its mRNA expression as well as induce its antiviral action. These findings indicate that analysis of publicly available transcriptomic and toxicogenomic data represents a rapid approach for the identification of novel targets and molecules that can modify the action of such targets during the early phases of emerging infections like COVID-19.">

Finding an antiviral drug or a vaccine is the only route for humans’ survival against it. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has been confirmed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been widely regarded as a promising solution to combat harmful microorganisms. They are biologically active molecules produced by different organisms as an essential component of their innate immune response against invading pathogens. Lactoferrin (LF), one of the AMPs, is an iron-binding glycoprotein that is present in several mucosal secretions. The antiviral activity of LF exists against a wide range of human and animal viruses (DNA and RNA). LF was proven to increase the host immunity against viral infection. Since LF is one of the constituents of breast milk and significantly located at the mucosal layers of the human body, it is considered the first line of defense against microbial infection. LF was reported to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV infection. The significant antiviral activity of LF makes it a potential option as an immunity enhancer, a drug or a drug conjugate with conventional antivirals. The affordability, environmental safety, and efficiency of LFs will make them superior to all other control strategies.">

Outcomes after the saline washout procedure have been extensively described in adults, but rarely in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of early saline washout procedure for upper limb cytotoxic drug extravasation in children. Methods:All consecutive children with vesicant drug extravasation were retrospectively reviewed. The saline washout procedure was performed. Cosmetic aspect, residual pain and range of movement were analyzed as well as time to surgery and chemotherapy resumption at last follow-up. Results:Between 2014 and 2018, 13 cytotoxic vesicant drug extravasations occurred (mean age 8 years (sem 5)), including 11 treated by the saline washout procedure. At mean follow-up of 11 months (sem 7), the patients had no or low pain and ranges of movement were fully conserved. Two patients (one within the six hours' delay) had soft-tissue necrosis leading to extensive reconstructive surgery. Conclusion:The saline washout procedure is safe and easy and significantly reduces the incidence of extensive skin damage. Early referral to a specialized department is essential. However, the key parameter remains prevention by educating medical staff and nurses about these injuries and by training them for early and urgent management. Level of Evidence:IV.">

Although herpes reactivation after the injection of hyaluronic acid is rare, it produces quite a huge pressure and panic on patients. Quite a lot cosmetic practitioners have no awareness of preventing, diagnosing, and giving correct treatment in time due to lack of experience. PATIENT CONCERNS:A 24-year-old woman presented with erythema, crusted papules, pain and swelling on the nose after receiving the injection of hyaluronic acid. A swab of the discharge fluid was obtained for bacterial and viral culture, showing positive for herpes simplex virus. DIAGNOSIS:The patient was diagnosed as herpes reactivation after the injection of hyaluronic acid. INTERVENTIONS:The patient underwent antiviral therapy with acyclovir 400 mg, 3 times daily for seven days. OUTCOMES:After a week of antiviral treatment, the clinical signs improved. CONCLUSION:Herpes reactivation after the injection of hyaluronic acid is quite rare but needed sufficient attention of cosmetic practitioners to make the proper diagnosis, prevention and treatment.">

Several new and repurposed drugs are being tested for their effectiveness in the treatment regime, and the development of vaccines is underway. The availability of genome sequence information of the virus and the identification of potential targets to neutralize and eradicate the infection have enabled the search for novel as well as existing molecules to perform the desired function. However, the application of plants in the development of potential biomolecules, such as antibiotics and vaccines, is limited. Traditional medicines involving plant-based formulations have proven successful in boosting immunity and providing tolerance to virus infections. Still, in-depth studies are not available to explore the bioactive compounds of plant origin and their mechanism of action. Given this, the current opinion article conveys our thoughts and perspectives on the promising usage of plant-based biomolecules in circumventing SARS-CoV-2, and how these molecules can work synergistically with other potential drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2.">

To expedite the development of such treatment, pharmaceutical companies and government agencies are currently testing several existing drugs for their effect on the virus. Gene-Eden-VIR and Novirin are natural, broad-spectrum, antiviral treatments proven to be safe and effective in several clinical studies. In this article, we present evidence indicating that the 5 Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin ingredients have anti-betacoronavirus, and specifically, anti-SARS-CoV effects. We consider this evidence as a first indication of the anti-coronavirus effects of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin. Next, we are planning to conduct a clinical study with users of the treatments to test the effects of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on individuals at risk and those infected with the virus.">

Tocilizumab was applied and intended to target both COVID-19 and RA. However, disease of this patient aggravated after usage of tocilizumab. After the discussion of a multiple disciplinary team (MDT) including rheumatologists, antimicrobial treatments were applied to target the potential opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus), which were authenticated several days later via high throughput sequencing. As an important cytokine in immune responses, IL-6 can be a double-edged sword: interference in the IL-6-IL-6 receptor signaling may save patients from cytokine release storm (CRS), but can also weaken the anti-infectious immunity, particularly in rheumatic patients, who may have received a long-term treatment with immunosuppressive/modulatory agents. Thus, we suggest careful considerations before and close monitoring in the administration of tocilizumab in rheumatic patients with COVID-19. Besides tocilizumab, several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can also be applied in the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, we also reviewed and discussed the application of these DMARDs in COVID-19 condition.">

        <span class="abst" title="More than five years ago, the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection was revolutionized with the introduction of all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs. They proved highly efficient in curing patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), including patients with cirrhosis. The new DAA treatments were alleged to induce significant improvements in clinical outcome and prognosis, but the exact cause of the expected benefit was unclear. Further, little was known about how the underlying liver disease would be affected during and after viral clearance. In this review, we describe and discuss the liver-related effects of the new treatments in regards to both pathophysiological aspects, such as macrophage activation, and the time-dependent effects of therapy, with specific emphasis on inflammation, structural liver changes, and liver function, as these factors are all related to morbidity and mortality in CHC patients. It seems clear that antiviral therapy, especially the achievement of a sustained virologic response has several beneficial effects on liver-related parameters in CHC patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. There seems to be a time-dependent effect of DAA therapy with viral clearance and the resolution of liver inflammation followed by more discrete changes in structural liver lesions. These improvements lead to favorable effects on liver function, followed by an improvement in cognitive dysfunction and portal hypertension. Overall, the data provide knowledge on the several beneficial effects of DAA therapy on liver-related parameters in CHC patients suggesting short- and long-term improvements in the underlying disease with the promise of an improved long-term prognosis.">

        <span class="abst" title="The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a recent pandemic called COVID-19 and a severe health threat around the world. In the current situation, the virus is rapidly spreading worldwide, and the discovery of a vaccine and potential therapeutics are critically essential. The crystal structure for the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), was recently made available and is considerably similar to the previously reported SARS-CoV. Due to its essentiality in viral replication, it represents a potential drug target. Herein, a computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach was implemented for the initial screening of 13 approved antiviral drugs. Molecular docking of 13 antivirals against the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme was accomplished, and indinavir was described as a lead drug with a docking score of -8.824 and a XP Gscore of -9.466 kcal/mol. Indinavir possesses an important pharmacophore, hydroxyethylamine (HEA), and thus, a new library of HEA compounds (&gt;2500) was subjected to virtual screening that led to 25 hits with a docking score more than indinavir. Exclusively, compound 16 with a docking score of -8.955 adhered to drug-like parameters, and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis was demonstrated to highlight the importance of chemical scaffolds therein. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis performed at 100 ns supported the stability of 16 within the binding pocket. Largely, our results supported that this novel compound 16 binds with domains I and II, and the domain II-III linker of the 3CLpro protein, suggesting its suitability as a strong candidate for therapeutic discovery against COVID-19.">

Patients with comorbidities are considered to be at higher risk for severe disease with acute respiratory failure, intensive care unit admission, and/or death. Particular vigilance has been warranted regarding the continuation of immunosuppressive treatments since viral clearing may be hampered in such cases. In contrast, it has also been hypothesized that overactive immune responses may trigger a cytokine storm associated with clinical deterioration, which has generated an interest in certain immunosuppressant drugs as potential treatment for COVID-19. We would like to present the first case report of a patient who was formally diagnosed with COVID-19 while being under disease-modifying treatment with rituximab, an anti-CD20 B cell depleting agent, for multiple sclerosis.

The lack of effective treatments, coupled with its etiology, has resulted in more than 400,000 deaths at the time of writing. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is highly homologous to that of SARS-CoV, the causative agent behind the 2003 SARS outbreak. Based on prior reports, clinicians have pursued the off-label use of several antiviral drugs, while the scientific community has responded by seeking agents against traditional targets, especially viral proteases. However, several avenues remain unexplored, including disrupting E and M protein oligomerization, outcompeting host glycan-virus interactions, interfering with the heparan sulfate proteoglycans-virus interaction, and others. In this review, we highlight some of these opportunities while summarizing the drugs currently in use against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).">

        <span class="abst" title="Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a highly contagious pathogen that causes acute upper respiratory infections and oral disease in cats, thus seriously endangering feline health. Recently, there have been outbreaks of particularly virulent variant strains of FCV, which can cause both acute symptoms and fatal systemic disease. The discovery of effective antiviral agents to treat FCV infection is, therefore, gradually assuming increased importance. In this study, we showed that both nitazoxanide and mizoribine had antiviral activity in F81 cells infected with different strains of FCV and also demonstrated a synergistic effect between the two drugs. Experiments in cats challenged with FCV showed that nitazoxanide significantly reduced the clinical symptoms of FCV infection, reduced viral load in the trachea and lungs, and reduced viral shedding. Our results showed that nitazoxanide and mizoribine could potentially be used as therapeutic agents to treat FCV infection.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVE:The use of tenofovir (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) has led to a decrease in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related events. However, whether there is a difference between the two agents in the extent of improving such outcomes has not been clarified thus far. Therefore, we aimed to compare TDF and ETV on the risk of HCC and mortality. DESIGN:A total of 7015 consecutive patients with CHB who were treated with TDF or ETV between February 2007 and January 2018 at the liver units of the Catholic University of Korea were screened for study eligibility and 3022 patients were finally analysed. Study end points were HCC and all-cause mortality or liver transplantation (LT) within 5 years after the initiation of antiviral therapy. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting methods were used. RESULTS:No difference was observed between TDF and ETV in the incidence rates of HCC in the entire cohort (HR 1.030; 95% CI 0.703 to 1.509, PSM model, p=0.880) and subgroups of patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Also, no difference was observed between TDF and ETV in the incidence rates of all-cause mortality or LT in the entire cohort (HR 1.090; 95% CI 0.622 to 1.911, PSM model, p=0.763), and patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. CONCLUSION:This study has demonstrated the clinical outcomes in patients with CHB who received TDF or ETV treatment. There was no difference in the intermediate-term risk of HCC and mortality or LT between the two drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="The pandemic of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-nCoV-2) is a global health crisis. Despite numerous preliminary results, there is as yet no treatment of proven efficacy for this condition. In this context, the pharmacological properties of lithium, better known as a treatment for mood disorders, merit closer examination. Lithium has shown in vitro efficacy at inhibiting the replication of coronaviruses responsible for gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in animals. It has immunomodulatory properties that may be of additional benefit in moderating the host inflammatory response to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, there is evidence that lithium may exert a protective action against upper respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses in patients taking it for other indications. These promising reports must be balanced against the narrow therapeutic index and high risk of toxicity associated with lithium therapy, its documented interactions with several commonly used drugs, and the absence of evidence of its efficacy against coronaviruses responsible for human disease. Nevertheless, naturalistic studies of the risk of COVID-19 in patients already receiving lithium could provide indirect evidence of its efficacy, and understanding the putative antiviral and immune-regulatory mechanisms of lithium in models of SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide leads for the development of safer and more effective treatments with a specific action against COVID-19.">

We comment on hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir with zinc supplement, remdesivir, tocilizumab, ciclesonide, niclosamide and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION:Effective therapies are urgently needed to manage COVID-19, and existing drugs such as antivirals and antimalarials are under investigation for repurposing to meet this need.

A brief understanding of the complex interactions of both viral as well as host targets, and the possible repurposed drug candidates are described with an emphasis on understanding the mechanisms at the molecular level.">

Based on literature and our own experience we propose new interventions, including the use of amiodarone, simvastatin, pioglitazone and curcumin. In mild infections (sore throat, cough) we advocate prompt local treatment for the naso-pharynx (inhalations; aerosols; nebulizers); for moderate to severe infections we propose a tried-and-true treatment: the combination of arginine and ascorbate, administered orally or intravenously. The material is organized in three sections: i) Clinical aspects of COVID-19; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); known treatments; ii) Structure and functions of SARS-CoV2 and proposed antiviral drugs; iii) The combination of arginine-ascorbate.">

This infodemic also included sensational and distorted information about drugs that likely first influenced opinion leaders and people particularly active on social media and then other people, thus affecting choices by individual patients everywhere. In particular, information has spread about some drugs approved for other indications (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, favipiravir, and umifenovir) that could have led to inappropriate and therefore hazardous use. In this article, we analyze the rationale behind the claims for use of these drugs in COVID-19, the communication about their effects on the disease, the consequences of this communication on people's behavior, and the responses of some influential regulatory authorities in an attempt to minimize the actual or potential risks arising from this behavior. Finally, we discuss the role of pharmacovigilance stakeholders in emergency management and possible strategies to deal with other similar crises in the future.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recently, treatment of HCV infection has been improved after the development of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) which target different viral proteins (NS3-4A, NS5A and NS5B). The activity and effectiveness of these DAAs are affected by the presence of resistance associated substitutions (RASs). This study aimed to characterize HCV genotypes circulating among Egyptian HCV patients, to dissect the full sequences of HCV NS3-4A and NS5B regions, and to characterize RASs associated with NS3-4A and NS5B inhibitors in HCV treatment-naïve patients. Genotyping of 80 HCV samples from treatment-naïve patients was done using restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analysis based on some full NS5B sequences. Results showed the prevalence of HCV subtype 4a. Twenty four new full sequences of NS3-4A and NS5B regions of subtype 4a were deposited in the GenBank database. In general, the substitutions associated with NS3-4A-targeting drugs were absent predicting possible responsiveness of Egyptian HCV patients to these drugs. In addition, the absence of amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to Sofosbuvir may predict good response to treatment with Sofosbuvir. Some amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to different classes of non-nucleoside inhibitors were detected. Further investigations on treated Egyptian HCV patients may evaluate the effectiveness of the massively used drugs. Many predicted T-cell-binding epitopes in NS3-4A and NS5B regions were found to be highly conserved in the currently studied isolates; a finding that might be important for HCV vaccine development. We demonstrated potential NS3 epitopes that could be used in engineering T cells against HCV epitopes.">

        <span class="abst" title="BackgroundTreatment of COVID-19 is mostly symptomatic, but a wide range of medications are under investigation against SARS-CoV-2. Although pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials, they will inevitably receive therapies whenever they appear effective in non-pregnant patients and even under compassionate use.MethodWe conducted a review of the literature on placental transfer and pregnancy safety data of drugs under current investigation for COVID-19.ResultsRegarding remdesivir, there are no data in pregnant women. Several other candidates already have safety data in pregnant women, since they are repurposed drugs already used for their established indications. They may thus be used in pregnancy, although their safety in the context of COVID-19 may differ from conventional use. These include the HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir which have low placental transfer; interferon which does not cross the placental barrier, and (hydroxy) chloroquine, which have high placental transfer. There are also pregnancy safety and placental transfer data for colchicine, steroids, oseltamivir and azithromycin, as well as some monoclonals. However, some drugs are strictly prohibited in pregnancy due to known teratogenicity (thalidomide) or fetal toxicities (renin-angiotensin system blockers). Other candidates including tocilizumab and other IL-6 inhibitors, umifenovir and favipiravir have insufficient data on pregnancy outcomes.ConclusionIn life-threatening cases of COVID-19, the potential risks of therapy to the fetus may be more than offset by the benefit of curing the mother. While preclinical and placental transfer studies are required for a number of potential anti-SARS CoV2 drugs, several medications can already be used in pregnant women.">

        <span class="abst" title="Purpose:In interferon-free era, direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have achieved high eradication rates with an excellent safety profile since revolutionized the management of hepatitis c virus (HCV) patients. Published papers have suggested a possible increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after successful DAAs treatment. Other papers have been published about the problem but without conclusive results. Because of this debate, we aim to evaluate the effects of antiviral therapy (Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir with or without Ribavirin) on the de novo occurrence of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). Patients and Methods:A prospective cohort study has included 350 patients who have visited our center for HCV treatment. Pretreatment history, examination, complete blood picture, liver function tests, kidney function tests, HA1C for diabetic patients, HCV PCR, HBsAg, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and abdominal ultrasound have been done, also Child-Pogh (CP) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score before treatment. These investigations have been repeated for 3 months after the end of treatment. Abdominal ultrasound (US) has been done for 3 months after treatment and every 4 months for 2 years after the end of treatment to detect HCC occurrence. Results:Patients age (58.11 ± 7.48), 55.4% of patients were males, 30.3% of patients were diabetic, 84.3% of them were treatment naïve and sustained virological response (SVR) occured in 94% of them. HCC occurrence after treatment was 6.7% in patients with SVR and 23.8% in patients with non-SVR (P value=0.016) during follow-up period. There is significant improvement of CP score. No significant changes in MELD score. Conclusion:Treatment of HCV-related LC patients with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin for 3 or 6 months showed high SVR and significant improvement in CP score, but still at risk of HCC even if treated and should be followed up regularly according to screening programs with special meticulous attention to those with non-SVR.">

Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus member of the family Arteriviridae from the order Nidovirales like the Coronaviridae. EAV causes respiratory and reproductive diseases in equids. Although two vaccines are available, the vaccination coverage of the equine population is largely insufficient to prevent new EAV outbreaks around the world. In this study, we present a high-throughput in vitro assay suitable for testing candidate antiviral molecules on equine dermal cells infected by EAV. Using this assay, we identified three molecules that impair EAV infection in equine cells: the broad-spectrum antiviral and nucleoside analog ribavirin, and two compounds previously described as inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the fourth enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. These molecules effectively suppressed cytopathic effects associated to EAV infection, and strongly inhibited viral replication and production of infectious particles. Since ribavirin is already approved in human and small animal, and that several DHODH inhibitors are in advanced clinical trials, our results open new perspectives for the management of EAV outbreaks.">

        <span class="abst" title="Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the main pathogen of hepatitis worldwide. However, its infection biology and pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Suitable small-animal models are required to advance the study of HEV infection. Although an efficient model of genotype 1 (gt1) and gt3 HEV infection has been established in human liver chimeric mice, the infectivity of gt4 HEV infection in mice has not been comprehensively characterized. In this study, immunocompromised BALB/c nude, immunocompetent BALB/c, and C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with either gt3 or gt4 HEV (19 HEV strains, including human, swine, macaque-adapted, and cow HEV strains). Infectivity was identified by viral RNA and antigen detection, inflammation, and histopathological analysis. Then, HEV-infected BALB/c mice were treated with antiviral drugs. Acute HEV infection was established in BALB/c mice inoculated with eight gt4 HEV strains. However, gt3 HEV strains failed to achieve active HEV infection. HEV infection was established in BALB/c nude and regular mice inoculated with gt4 HEV but not in C57BL/6 mice. Gt4 HEV infection resulted in rapid viremia and high titers in feces, sera, and replication sites. HEV infection in mice showed no gender preference. Furthermore, chronic gt4 HEV infection was well imitated in BALB/c mice for 32 weeks and caused liver fibrosis. Conclusion:BALB/c mice have a great potential for reproducing the process of gt4 HEV infection. The successful establishment of a gt4 HEV small-animal model provides an opportunity to further understand HEV infection biology and zoonotic transmission and develop anti-HEV vaccine.">

        <span class="abst" title="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most frequent cause of opportunistic viral infection following transplantation. Viral factors of potential clinical importance include the selection of mutants resistant to antiviral drugs and the occurrence of infections involving multiple HCMV strains. These factors are typically addressed by analyzing relevant HCMV genes by PCR and Sanger sequencing, which involves independent assays of limited sensitivity. To assess the dynamics of viral populations with high sensitivity, we applied high-throughput sequencing coupled with HCMV-adapted target enrichment to samples collected longitudinally from 11 transplant recipients (solid organ, n = 9, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell, n = 2). Only the latter presented multiple-strain infections. Four cases presented resistance mutations (n = 6), two (A594V and L595S) at high (100%) and four (V715M, V781I, A809V, and T838A) at low (&lt;25%) frequency. One allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient presented up to four resistance mutations, each at low frequency. The use of high-throughput sequencing to monitor mutations and strain composition in people at risk of HCMV disease is of potential value in helping clinicians implement the most appropriate therapy.">

Very little is known about the infection mechanism for this virus. More importantly, there are no drugs or vaccines that can cure or prevent a person from getting COVID-19. In this study, the binding affinity of 2692 protease inhibitor compounds that are known in the protein data bank, are calculated against the main protease of the novel coronavirus with docking and molecular dynamics (MD). Both the docking and MD methods predict the macrocyclic tissue factor-factor VIIa (PubChem ID: 118098670) inhibitor to bind strongly with the main protease with a binding affinity of -10.6 and -10.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The TF-FVIIa inhibitors are known to prevent the coagulation of blood and have antiviral activity as shown in the case of SARS coronavirus. Two more inhibitors, phenyltriazolinones (PubChem ID: 104161460) and allosteric HCV NS5B polymerase thumb pocket 2 (PubChem ID: 163632044) have shown antiviral activity and also have high affinity towards the main protease of COVID-19. Furthermore, these inhibitors interact with the catalytic dyad in the active site of the COVID-19 main protease that is especially important in viral replication. The calculated theoretical dissociation constants of the proposed COVID-19 inhibitors are found to be very similar to the experimental dissociation constant values of similar protease-inhibitor systems.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

So far as a result of this epidemic, 4,434,653 confirmed cases and 302,169 deaths are reported. The growing infection rate and death toll demand the use of all possible approaches to design novel drugs and vaccines to curb this disease. In this study, we combined drugs repurposing and virtual drug screening strategies to target 3CLpro, which has an essential role in viral maturation and replication. A total of 31 FDA approved anti-HIV drugs, and Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) database were screened to find potential inhibitors. As a result, Saquinavir, and five drugs (TCM5280805, TCM5280445, TCM5280343, TCM5280863, and TCM5458190) from the TCM database were found as promising hits. Furthermore, results from molecular dynamics simulation and total binding free energy revealed that Saquinavir and TCM5280805 target the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) and possess stable dynamics behavior. Thus, we suggest that these compounds should be tested experimentally against the SARS-COV-2 as Saquinavir has been reported to inhibit HIV protease experimentally. Considering the intensity of coronavirus dissemination, the present research is in line with the idea of discovering the latest inhibitors against the coronavirus essential pathways to accelerate the drug development cycle.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Due to the rapid human to human transmission of Covid-19, we are in need to find a potent drug at the earliest by ruling-out the traditional time-consuming approach of drug development. This is only possible if we use reliable computational approaches for screening compounds from chemical space or by drug repurposing or by finding the phytochemicals and nutraceuticals from plants as they can be immediately used without the need for carrying out drug-trials to test safety and efficacy. A number of plant products were routinely suggested as drugs in traditional Indian and Chinese medicine. Here using molecular docking approach, and combined molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA based free energy calculations approach, we study the potency of the four selected phytochemicals namely andrographolide (AGP1), 14-deoxy 11,12-didehydro andrographolide (AGP2), neoandrographolide (AGP3) and 14-deoxy andrographolide (AGP4) from A. paniculata plant against the four key targets including three non-structural proteins (3 L main protease (3CLpro), Papain-like proteinase (PLpro) and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp)) and a structural protein (spike protein (S)) of the virus which are responsible for replication, transcription and host cell recognition. The therapeutic potential of the selected phytochemicals against Covid-19 were also evaluated in comparison with a few commercially available drugs. The binding free energy data suggest that AGP3 could be used as a cost-effective drug-analog for treating covid-19 infection in developing countries.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.">

Globally, more than 3,517,345 cases have been confirmed with 243,401 deaths due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19. The antiviral drug discovery activity is required to control the persistence of COVID-19 circulation and the potential of the future emergence of coronavirus. However, the present review aims to highlight the important antiviral approaches, including interferons, ribavirin, mycophenolic acids, ritonavir, lopinavir, inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to provoke the nonstructural proteins and deactivate the structural and essential host elements of the virus to control and treat the infection of COVID-19 by inhibiting the viral entry, viral RNA replication and suppressing the viral protein expression. Moreover, the present review investigates the epidemiology, diagnosis, structure, and replication of COVID-19 for better understanding. It is recommended that these proteases, inhibitors, and antibodies could be a good therapeutic option in drug discovery to control the newly emerged coronavirus.HighlightsCOVID-19 has more than 79.5% identical sequence to SARS-CoV and a 96% identical sequence of the whole genome of bat coronaviruses.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and septic shock are the possible clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19.Different antivirals, including interferons, ribavirin, lopinavir, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be the potent therapeutic agents against COVID-19.The initial clinical trials on hydroquinone in combination with azithromycin showed an admirable result in the reduction of COVID-19.The overexpression of inflammation response, cytokine dysregulation, and induction of apoptosis could be an well-organized factors to reduce the pathogenicity of COVID-19.">

        <span class="abst" title="The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak that affected whole the world with more than 6 million confirmed cases and over 370,000 deaths. At present, there are no effective treatments or vaccine for this disease, which constitutes a serious global health crisis. As the pandemic still spreading around the globe, it is of interest to use computational methods to identify potential inhibitors for the virus. The crystallographic structures of 3CLpro (PDB: 6LU7) and RdRp (PDB 6ML7) were used in virtual screening of 50000 chemical compounds obtained from the CAS Antiviral COVID19 database using 3D-similarity search and standard molecular docking followed by ranking and selection of compounds based on their binding affinity, computational techniques for the sake of details on the binding interactions, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity prediction; we report three 4-(morpholin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine derivatives; two compounds (2001083-68-5 and 2001083-69-6) with optimal binding features to the active site of the main protease and one compound (833463-19-7) with optimal binding features to the active site of the polymerase for further consideration to fight COVID-19. The structural stability and dynamics of lead compounds at the active site of 3CLpro and RdRp were examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Essential dynamics demonstrated that the three complexes remain stable during simulation of 20 ns, which may be suitable candidates for further experimental analysis. As the identified leads share the same scaffold, they may serve as promising leads in the development of dual 3CLpro and RdRp inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.">

These may have serious adverse effects and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents. We reviewed the common agents being used across the world for the treatment of COVID-19 and investigated their drug interaction potential with psychotropic agents using several drug interaction databases and resources. A preliminary search identified the following drugs as being used to treat COVID-19 symptoms: atazanavir (ATV), azithromycin (AZI), chloroquine (CLQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCLQ), dipyridamole, famotidine (FAM), favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), nitazoxanide, remdesivir, ribavirin and tocilizumab. Many serious adverse effects and potential drug interactions with psychotropic agents were identified. The most problematic agents were found to be ATV, AZI, CLQ, HCLQ, FAM and LPV/r in terms of both pharmacokinetic as well as serious pharmacodynamic drug interactions, including QTc prolongation and neutropenia. Significant caution should be exercised if using any of the medications being trialled for the treatment of COVID-19 until robust clinical trial data are available. An even higher threshold of vigilance should be maintained for patients with pre-existing conditions and older adults due to added toxicity and drug interactions, especially with psychotropic agents.">

        <span class="abst" title="Essential oils (EOs) have risen in popularity over the past decade. These oils function in society as holistic integrative modalities to traditional medicinal treatments, where many Americans substitute EOs in place of other prescribed medications. EOs are found in a multitude of products including food flavoring, soaps, lotions, shampoos, hair styling products, cologne, laundry detergents, and even insect repellents. EOs are complex substances comprised of hundreds of components that can vary greatly in their composition depending upon the extraction process by the producer or the origin of the plant. Thus, making it difficult to determine which pathways in the body are affected. Here, we review the published research that shows the health benefits of EOs as well as some of their adverse effects. In doing so, we show that EOs, as well as some of their individual components, possess antimicrobial, antiviral, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties as well as purported psychogenic effects such as relieving stress, treating depression, and aiding with insomnia. Not only do we show the health benefits of using EOs, but we also indicate risks associated with their use such as their endocrine disrupting properties leading to the induction of premature breast growth in young adolescents. Taken together, there are many positive and potentially negative risks to human health associated with EOs, which make it important to bring awareness to all their known effects on the human body.">

Recent findings suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are less affected by SARS-CoV-2 than their caregivers, which may seem surprising given some of the frequent risk factors for an unfavorable course of the disease (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases).We propose here a mixed pharmacoepidemiological and pharmacochemical hypothesis to explain these findings. A number of psychotropic drugs exhibit activities against coronaviruses (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and the Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV)) and have been put forward as potentially anti-SARS-CoV-2. These treatments include numerous mee-too drugs (chemically and pharmacologically linked to those which have demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy) which are frequently prescribed in psychiatric settings. Taken alone or in polypharmacy, these drugs could have a prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, explaining the unexpectedly low proportion of patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. Associated factors such as nicotine can also be considered in the context of a broad chemoprophylactic hypothesis in patients with psychiatric disorders taking different psychoactive substances.">

        <span class="abst" title="Safe and efficient drugs to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic are urgently needed. In this context, we have analyzed the anti-coronavirus potential of the natural product glycyrrhizic acid (GLR), a drug used to treat liver diseases (including viral hepatitis) and specific cutaneous inflammation (such as atopic dermatitis) in some countries. The properties of GLR and its primary active metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid are presented and discussed. GLR has shown activities against different viruses, including SARS-associated Human and animal coronaviruses. GLR is a non-hemolytic saponin and a potent immuno-active anti-inflammatory agent which displays both cytoplasmic and membrane effects. At the membrane level, GLR induces cholesterol-dependent disorganization of lipid rafts which are important for the entry of coronavirus into cells. At the intracellular and circulating levels, GLR can trap the high mobility group box 1 protein and thus blocks the alarmin functions of HMGB1. We used molecular docking to characterize further and discuss both the cholesterol- and HMG box-binding functions of GLR. The membrane and cytoplasmic effects of GLR, coupled with its long-established medical use as a relatively safe drug, make GLR a good candidate to be tested against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, alone and in combination with other drugs. The rational supporting combinations with (hydroxy)chloroquine and tenofovir (two drugs active against SARS-CoV-2) is also discussed. Based on this analysis, we conclude that GLR should be further considered and rapidly evaluated for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.">

        <span class="abst" title="AIM:Older patients with chronic hepatitis C infection starting direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are frequently prescribed multiple medications that may be categorized as inappropriate. Anticholinergic burden has been shown to be a predictor of adverse health and functional outcomes. Different scales are available to calculate anticholinergic burden. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anticholinergic medication among older patients treated with DAAs and the risk factors associated using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale, the Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS) and the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS) and analyze the resulting safety consequences. METHODS:Observational, retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients ≥65 years old receiving DAAs and taking concomitant medication. This study was conducted in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of observational studies in Epidemiology Statement. RESULTS:236 patients were included. The average age was 71.7 years, 73.3% cirrhotic, and 47% patients took ≥5 medicines. According to the ACB, ARS and ADS scales, 35.2% (n = 83), 10.6% (n = 25) and 34.3% (n = 81) of the patients were treated with anticholinergic medication. Two hundred-and-six (86%) patients presented any adverse events (AEs) during therapy. ARS scale showed a significant relationship between presence of anticholinergic medication and AEs. A large number of patients suffered anticholinergic events, with more events per patient in patients taking anticholinergic drugs. CONCLUSIONS:Older hepatitis C chronic patients are exposed to potentially inappropriate polypharmacy and anticholinergic risk, according to the ACB, ARS and ADS scales. The three scales showed different results. Only the ARS scale was associated with AEs, but the rate of anticholinergic effects per patient was significantly higher in patients with anticholinergic drugs, regardless of the scale used. Consider quality of pharmacotherapy when starting DAA with a multidisciplinary approach could improve health outcomes.">

As emerging infectious diseases, they were characterized by their novel pathogens and transmissibility without available clinical drugs or vaccines. This is especially true for the newly identified COVID-19 caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for which, to date, no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines have been approved. Similar to SARS and MERS, the lag time in the development of therapeutics is likely to take months to years. These facts call for the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drugs targeting a conserved target site.

COVID-19 pathology is characterized by extreme inflammation and amplified immune response with activation of a cytokine storm. A subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can take place, which is often followed by death. The causes of these strong inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unknown. As uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation is likely the main cause of death in SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-inflammatory therapeutic interventions are particularly important. Fenretinide N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide is a bioactive molecule characterized by poly-pharmacological properties and a low toxicity profile. Fenretinide is endowed with antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulating properties other than efficacy in obesity/diabetic pathologies. Its anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities, in particular, could likely have utility in multimodal therapies for the treatment of ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, fenretinide administration by pulmonary delivery systems could further increase its therapeutic value by carrying high drug concentrations to the lungs and triggering a rapid onset of activity. This is particularly important in SARS-CoV-2 infection, where only a narrow time window exists for therapeutic intervention.">

Currently, there are no specific or effective treatments against DENV and ZIKV. Previous studies have shown that tyrosine kinase activities and signal transduction are involved in flavivirus replication, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for DENV and ZIKV. In this study, we found that compound L3 can significantly reduce viral protein expression and viral titers in HEK-293, MCF-7, HepG2, and Huh-7 cells and exhibits superior therapeutic efficacy against flaviviral infection compared to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In addition, compound L3 can decrease endogenous HER2 activation and inhibit the phosphorylation of the HER2 downstream signaling molecules Src and ERK1/2, the levels of which have been associated with viral protein expression in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, silencing HER2 diminished DENV-2 and ZIKV expression in MCF-7 cells, which suggests that HER2 activity is involved in flavivirus replication. Furthermore, in DENV-2-infected AG129 mice, treatment with compound L3 increased the survival rates and reduced the viremia levels. Overall, compound L3 demonstrates therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo and could be developed as a promising antiviral drug against emerging flaviviruses or for concurrent DENV and ZIKV outbreaks.">

        <span class="abst" title="From a healthcare perspective, infection due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the ensuing syndrome called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents the biggest challenge the world has faced in several decades. Particularly worrisome are the high contagiousness of the virus and the saturation of hospitals' capacity due to overwhelming caseloads. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine and inter-personal distancing are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus in the general population, but more tailored interventions may be needed at an individual level on a case-by-case basis. In this perspective, the most insidious situation is when an individual has contact with a contagious subject without adequate protection. If rapidly recognized afterwards, this occurrence may be promptly addressed through a post-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PEP) with antiviral drugs. This strategy has been implemented for other respiratory viruses (influenza above all) and was successfully used in South Korea among healthcare workers against the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, by providing people who were exposed to high-risk contacts with lopinavir-ritonavir plus ribavirin. Initial experiences with the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 also seem promising. Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis might help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the current phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.">

Here, we implement an original virtual screening (VS) protocol for repositioning approved drugs in order to predict which of them could inhibit the main protease of the virus (M-pro), a key target for antiviral drugs given its essential role in the virus' replication. Two different libraries of approved drugs were docked against the structure of M-pro using Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina, and only the equivalent high affinity binding modes predicted simultaneously by the three docking programs were considered to correspond to bioactive poses. In this way, we took advantage of the three sampling algorithms to generate hypothetic binding modes without relying on a single scoring function to rank the results. Seven possible SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors were predicted using this approach: Perampanel, Carprofen, Celecoxib, Alprazolam, Trovafloxacin, Sarafloxacin and ethyl biscoumacetate. Carprofen and Celecoxib have been selected by the COVID Moonshot initiative for in vitro testing; they show 3.97 and 11.90% M-pro inhibition at 50 µM, respectively.">

        <span class="abst" title="Viruses use cell machinery to replicate their genome and produce viral proteins. For this reason, several intracellular factors, including the redox state, might directly or indirectly affect the progression and outcome of viral infection. In physiological conditions, the redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant species is maintained by enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems, and it finely regulates several cell functions. Different viruses break this equilibrium and induce an oxidative stress that in turn facilitates specific steps of the virus lifecycle and activates an inflammatory response. In this context, many studies highlighted the importance of redox-sensitive pathways as novel cell-based targets for therapies aimed at blocking both viral replication and virus-induced inflammation. In the review, we discuss the most recent findings in this field. In particular, we describe the effects of natural or synthetic redox-modulating molecules in inhibiting DNA or RNA virus replication as well as inflammatory pathways. The importance of the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 is also discussed. Most of the data reported here are on influenza virus infection. We believe that this approach could be usefully applied to fight other acute respiratory viral infections characterized by a strong inflammatory response, like COVID-19.">

The effective drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease Mpro, because of its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. In this study, the bioactivity of some selected heterocyclic drugs named Favipiravir (1), Amodiaquine (2), 2'-Fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (3), and Ribavirin (4) was evaluated as inhibitors and nucleotide analogues for COVID-19 using computational modeling strategies. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the thermal parameters, dipole moment, polarizability, and molecular electrostatic potential of the present drugs; additionally, Mulliken atomic charges of the drugs as well as the chemical reactivity descriptors were investigated. The nominated drugs were docked on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6LU7) to evaluate the binding affinity of these drugs. Besides, the computations data of DFT the docking simulation studies was predicted that the Amodiaquine (2) has the least binding energy (-7.77 Kcal/mol) and might serve as a good inhibitor to SARS-CoV-2 comparable with the approved medicines, hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir which have binding affinity -6.06 and -4.96 Kcal/mol, respectively. The high binding affinity of 2 was attributed to the presence of three hydrogen bonds along with different hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the critical amino acids residues of the receptor. Finally, the estimated molecular electrostatic potential results by DFT were used to illustrate the molecular docking findings. The DFT calculations showed that drug 2 has the highest of lying HOMO, electrophilicity index, basicity, and dipole moment. All these parameters could share with different extent to significantly affect the binding affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites.">

Although multiple drugs show promise in the treatment of COVID-19 via either inhibiting viral replication or preventing fusion of the virus to the ACE2 receptors, further investigation is still warranted and necessary before the admission of any type of pharmaceutical agent. Furthermore, several supplements have also been documented in being utilized as treatment of COVID-19. The exact mechanism and efficacy of current candidate drugs are still being explored through clinical trials. Despite the advancements in current research with emerging treatments, social distancing and engaging in preventative measures remains crucial to attempt to prevent the occurrence of more cases and deaths, worldwide.

Retrospective studies have identified hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and older age as risk factors for high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. There is a general concern that patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases, namely those on immunosuppressive therapies and/or those with more advanced kidney failure, could particularly be at risk for adverse outcomes due to a compromised antiviral immunity. Uncertainties exist on how management routines should be reorganized to minimize the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and what measures are necessary for infected patients. The aim of the present review of the Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association is to provide recommendations for the management of patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases based on the available evidence, similar circumstances with other infectious organisms and expert opinions from across Europe. Such recommendations may help to minimize the risk of encountering COVID-19 or developing complications during COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated kidney disease.">

        <span class="abst" title="AbstractBackgroundEffective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Chloroquine has been proved to have antiviral effect against coronavirus in vitro. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of chloroquine with different doses in COVID-19.MethodIn this multicenter prospective observational study, we enrolled patients older than 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection excluding critical cases from 12 hospitals in Guangdong and Hubei Provinces. Eligible patients received chloroquine phosphate 500 mg, orally, once (half dose) or twice (full dose) daily. Patients treated with non-chloroquine therapy were included as historical controls. The primary endpoint is the time to undetectable viral RNA. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with undetectable viral RNA by day 10 and 14, hospitalization time, duration of fever, and adverse events.ResultsA total of 197 patients completed chloroquine treatment, and 176 patients were included as historical controls. The median time to achieve an undetectable viral RNA was shorter in chloroquine than in non-chloroquine (absolute difference in medians -6.0 days; 95% CI -6.0 to -4.0). The duration of fever is shorter in chloroquine (geometric mean ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8). No serious adverse events were observed in the chloroquine group. Patients treated with half dose experienced lower rate of adverse events than with full dose.ConclusionsAlthough randomised trials are needed for further evaluation, this study provides evidence for safety and efficacy of chloroquine in COVID-19 and suggests that chloroquine can be a cost-effective therapy for combating the COVID-19 pandemic.">

Five were diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because of compatible symptoms, while two were diagnosed by RT-PCR as a result of screening 197 HD patients without respiratory symptoms by chest CT. Thirteen of 197 patients had positive chest CT features and, of these, 2 (15%) were confirmed to have COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients, the most common features at admission were fatigue, fever and diarrhea [5/7 (71%) had all these]. Common laboratory features included lymphocytopenia [6/7 (86%)], elevated lactate dehydrogenase [3/4 (75%)], D-dimer [5/6 (83%)], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [4/4 (100%)] and procalcitonin [5/5 (100%)]. Chest CT showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Four of seven (57%) received oxygen therapy, one (14%) received noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, five (71%) received antiviral and antibacterial drugs, three (43%) recieved glucocorticoid therapy and one (14%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. As the last follow-up, four of the seven patients (57%) had been discharged and three patients were dead.ConclusionsChest CT may identify COVID-19 patients without clear symptoms, but the specificity is low. The mortality of COVID-19 patients on HD was high.">

Unfortunately, there is no chemotherapeutic agent in the regimen of antiviral drugs or no vaccine available to curb this infectious disease.

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral disease. In this study, we tried to define and discuss all the findings on the potential association between arachidonic acid (AA) pathway and COVID-19 pathophysiology. METHODS:A literature search across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane database was conducted. A total of 25 studies were identified. RESULTS:The data elucidated that COX-2 and prostaglandins (PGs), particularly PGE2, have pro-inflammatory action in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Arachidonic acid can act as endogenous antiviral compound. A deficiency in AA can make humans more susceptible to COVID-19. Targeting these pro-inflammatory mediators may help in decreasing the mortality and morbidity rate in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS:PGE2 levels and other PGs levels should be measured in patients with COVID-19. Lowering the PGE2 levels through inhibition of human microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) can enhance the host immune response against COVID-19. In addition, the hybrid compounds, such as COX-2 inhibitors/TP antagonists, can be an innovative treatment to control the overall balance between AA mediators in patients with COVID-19.">

Point-of-care (POC) hepatitis C tests and dried blood spot (DBS) sampling offer benefits for the management of patients with HCV infection by increasing HCV testing and linkage to care in different nonclinical settings. The aims of this prospective study were to evaluate the feasibility and the acceptability of use HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) POC and fingerstick DBS testing in social-medical risk-reduction centers and to describe the cascade of care among PWID in France. Methods:Between June 2018 and February 2019, 89 consecutive HCV-seropositive PWID attending 2 drug treatment services and 1 supervised consumption room in inner Paris were invited to participate in further evaluation, undergoing a clinical review with a liver assessment and blood tests including fingerstick capillary whole blood POC HCV RNA testing and fingerstick DBS sampling. Results:Of the 89 participants enrolled, HCV RNA was detected in 34 (38.6%) participants. Fingerstick whole blood POC RNA testing and HCV RNA detection from DBS sample were feasible and acceptable among PWID with no major difference in terms of HCV RNA detection rate. Overall, 16 participants received pan-genotypic antiviral treatment. The proportion of PWID with sustained virologic response at 12 weeks was 81.2%, with data for 3 patients still pending. Conclusions:One-step screening strategy based on the detection of HCV RNA would engage people in care for treatment scale-up and HCV elimination.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The recent global pandemic has placed a high priority on identifying drugs to prevent or lessen clinical infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused by Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS:We applied two computational approaches to identify potential therapeutics. First, we sought to identify existing FDA approved drugs that could block coronaviruses from entering cells by binding to ACE2 or TMPRSS2 using a high-throughput AI-based binding affinity prediction platform. Second, we sought to identify FDA approved drugs that could attenuate the gene expression patterns induced by coronaviruses, using our Disease Cancelling Technology (DCT) platform. RESULTS:Top results for ACE2 binding iincluded several ACE inhibitors, a beta-lactam antibiotic, two antiviral agents (Fosamprenavir and Emricasan) and glutathione. The platform also assessed specificity for ACE2 over ACE1, important for avoiding counterregulatory effects. Further studies are needed to weigh the benefit of blocking virus entry against potential counterregulatory effects and possible protective effects of ACE2. However, the data herein suggest readily available drugs that warrant experimental evaluation to assess potential benefit. DCT was run on an animal model of SARS-CoV, and ranked compounds by their ability to induce gene expression signals that counteract disease-associated signals. Top hits included Vitamin E, ruxolitinib, and glutamine. Glutathione and its precursor glutamine were highly ranked by two independent methods, suggesting both warrant further investigation for potential benefit against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS:While these findings are not yet ready for clinical translation, this report highlights the potential use of two bioinformatics technologies to rapidly discover existing therapeutic agents that warrant further investigation for established and emerging disease processes.">

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a respiratory illness with symptoms such as dry cough, fever, sudden loss of smell, and, in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. To date, there is no specific vaccine or treatment proven effective against this viral disease. Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is thus critical to curbing its spread and improving health outcomes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is commonly used to detect the presence of COVID-19. Other techniques, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and microfluidics, have allowed better disease diagnosis. Here, as part of the effort to expand screening capacity, we review advances and challenges in the rapid detection of COVID-19 by targeting nucleic acids, antigens, or antibodies. We also summarize potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 and discuss ongoing clinical trials of interventions to reduce viral progression.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recommender systems (RSs), which underwent rapid development and had an enormous impact on e-commerce, have the potential to become useful tools for drug discovery. In this paper, we applied RS methods for the prediction of the antiviral activity class (active/inactive) for compounds extracted from ChEMBL. Two main RS approaches were applied: collaborative filtering (Surprise implementation) and content-based filtering (sparse-group inductive matrix completion (SGIMC) method). The effectiveness of RS approaches was investigated for prediction of antiviral activity classes (“interactions”) for compounds and viruses, for which some of their interactions with other viruses or compounds are known, and for prediction of interaction profiles for new compounds. Both approaches achieved relatively good prediction quality for binary classification of individual interactions and compound profiles, as quantified by cross-validation and external validation receiver operating characteristic (ROC) score &gt;0.9. Thus, even simple recommender systems may serve as an effective tool in antiviral drug discovery.">

They were prepared through two synthetic steps: The first step is via coupling of mercapto-derivatized heterocyclic bases with the appropriate α-bromo per-acetylated sugars. The second one is the hydrolysis of the acetate esters under basic conditions that were consequently conjugated with the phosphoramidating reagent to afford the desired thioglycoside protides. Eight compounds were evaluated for their antiviral activities against different viral cell lines, namely, adenovirus 7, HAV (hepatitis A) HM175, Coxsackievirus B4, and HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1), in addition to the antiviral bioassay against ED-43/SG-Feo (VYG) replicon of HCV (hepatitis C virus) genotype 4a. Both compounds 5b and 11 showed notable antiviral activity against Coxsackie virus B4, reflected from the CC50 values of 17 and 20 μg/100 μL and IC50 values of 4.5 and 6.0 μg/100 μL, respectively. Same two compounds elicited remarkable activities toward herpes simplex virus type 1, represented by CC50 values of 17 and 16 μg/100 μL and IC50 values of 6.3 and 6.6 μg/100 μL, respectively. Combination of 11 with acyclovir elicited a notable synergistic activity in comparison with acyclovir alone, as inferred from herpes simplex polymerase enzyme inhibitory assay values of 2.64 and 4.78 μg/100 mL, respectively. Only compound 11 elicited a remarkable activity against HCV. Potential promising activities of compound 11 have been shown with respect to CC50, IC50, and enzyme assay inhibitory activities.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Current outbreaks of COVID-19 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. Control measures, based on isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, can decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modeling work shows that these interventions may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. The effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. We aim to study whether antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce infectiousness, could be integrated into control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. METHODS:Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission, we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures to control local COVID-19 outbreaks. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Additionally, we investigate the implementation of an antiviral compound combined with the contact tracing process. RESULTS:For an infectious disease in which asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when combined with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. Antiviral drugs, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation, result in a significant decrease of the final size and the peak incidence, and increase the probability that the outbreak will fade out. CONCLUSION:In all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of control measures based on the testing of traced individuals. In addition, the administration of an antiviral drug, together with quarantine, isolation, and contact tracing, is shown to decrease the spread of the epidemic. This control measure could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.">

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot;, abbreviated to COVID-19, which despite only being identified at the very end of 2019, has now been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). At this time, no specific prophylactic or postexposure therapy for COVID-19 are currently available. Viral entry is the first step in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle and is mediated by the trimeric spike protein. Being the first stage in infection, entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. Within this review, we highlight therapeutic intervention strategies for anti-SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other coronaviruses and speculate upon future directions for SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor designs.">

The evidence of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) application on the previous epidemic encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak. This paper aims to comprehensively review the role of AI and ML as one significant method in the arena of screening, predicting, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug development for SARS-CoV-2 and its related epidemic.MethodA selective assessment of information on the research article was executed on the databases related to the application of ML and AI technology on Covid-19. Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters, i.e., abstract, methodology, and the conclusion was done to relate to the model's possibilities for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.ResultThis paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles. It also addresses a few errors and challenges while using such algorithms in real-world problems. The paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on model design, medical experts, and policymakers in the current situation while tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead.ConclusionThe ongoing development in AI and ML has significantly improved treatment, medication, screening, prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development process for the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice. However, most of the models are not deployed enough to show their real-world operation, but they are still up to the mark to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.">

The virus, subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, spread worldwide and the disease (coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Older adults and individuals with comorbidities have been reported as being more vulnerable to COVID-19. Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) have compromised immune function due to cirrhosis and are more susceptible to infection. However, it is unclear if patients with CLD are more vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications than other populations. The high number of severe cases of COVID-19 has placed an unusual burden on health systems, compromising their capacity to provide the regular care that patients with CLD require. Hence, it is incredibly crucial at this juncture to provide a set of interim recommendations on the management of patients with CLD during the current COVID-19 outbreak.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:To date, few data on paediatric COVID-19 have been published, and most reports originate from China. This study aimed to capture key data on children and adolescents with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection across Europe to inform physicians and health-care service planning during the ongoing pandemic. METHODS:This multicentre cohort study involved 82 participating health-care institutions across 25 European countries, using a well established research network-the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (ptbnet)-that mainly comprises paediatric infectious diseases specialists and paediatric pulmonologists. We included all individuals aged 18 years or younger with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, detected at any anatomical site by RT-PCR, between April 1 and April 24, 2020, during the initial peak of the European COVID-19 pandemic. We explored factors associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and initiation of drug treatment for COVID-19 using univariable analysis, and applied multivariable logistic regression with backwards stepwise analysis to further explore those factors significantly associated with ICU admission. FINDINGS:582 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, with a median age of 5·0 years (IQR 0·5-12·0) and a sex ratio of 1·15 males per female. 145 (25%) had pre-existing medical conditions. 363 (62%) individuals were admitted to hospital. 48 (8%) individuals required ICU admission, 25 (4%) mechanical ventilation (median duration 7 days, IQR 2-11, range 1-34), 19 (3%) inotropic support, and one (&lt;1%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Significant risk factors for requiring ICU admission in multivariable analyses were being younger than 1 month (odds ratio 5·06, 95% CI 1·72-14·87; p=0·0035), male sex (2·12, 1·06-4·21; p=0·033), pre-existing medical conditions (3·27, 1·67-6·42; p=0·0015), and presence of lower respiratory tract infection signs or symptoms at presentation (10·46, 5·16-21·23; p&lt;0·0001). The most frequently used drug with antiviral activity was hydroxychloroquine (40 [7%] patients), followed by remdesivir (17 [3%] patients), lopinavir-ritonavir (six [1%] patients), and oseltamivir (three [1%] patients). Immunomodulatory medication used included corticosteroids (22 [4%] patients), intravenous immunoglobulin (seven [1%] patients), tocilizumab (four [1%] patients), anakinra (three [1%] patients), and siltuximab (one [&lt;1%] patient). Four children died (case-fatality rate 0·69%, 95% CI 0·20-1·82); at study end, the remaining 578 were alive and only 25 (4%) were still symptomatic or requiring respiratory support. INTERPRETATION:COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including infants. However, a small proportion develop severe disease requiring ICU admission and prolonged ventilation, although fatal outcome is overall rare. The data also reflect the current uncertainties regarding specific treatment options, highlighting that additional data on antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are urgently needed.

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVES:To assess progress in Australia toward the 2030 WHO hepatitis C elimination targets two years after the introduction of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments. DESIGN:Analysis of quarterly data on government-subsidised hepatitis C RNA testing and hepatitis C treatment in Australia, January 2013 - June 2018. Changes in testing and treatment levels associated with DAA availability were assessed in an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) statistical model, and the impact by 2030 of different levels of testing and treatment were estimated using a mathematical model. MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURES:Hepatitis C prevalence among people who inject drugs; annual hepatitis C incidence relative to 2015 levels; projections for the hepatitis C care cascade in 2030. RESULTS:The mean annual number of treatments initiated for people with hepatitis C increased from 6747 during 2013-2015 (before the introduction of DAAs) to 28 022 during 2016-18; the mean annual number of diagnostic RNA tests increased from 17 385 to 23 819. If current trends in testing and treatment continue (ie, 2018 testing numbers are maintained but treatment numbers decline by 50%), it is projected that by 2030 only 72% of infected people would be treated (by 2025 all people diagnosed with hepatitis C would be treated). The incidence of hepatitis C in 2030 would be 59% lower than in 2015, well short of the WHO target of an 80% reduction. The identification and testing of people exposed to hepatitis C must be increased by at least 50% for Australia to reach the WHO elimination targets. CONCLUSION:Hepatitis C elimination programs in Australia should focus on increasing testing rates and linkage with care to maintain adequate levels of treatment.">

        <span class="abst" title="Zidovudine (ZDV) is an antiviral drug against HIV that was approved by the FDA on March, 1987. It is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. This type of drug stops the reproduction of DNA and decreases the amount of the virus in the patients' blood. Due to the ability of forming various molecular bonds, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used for the detection of large range of agents, including drugs. In this study, we synthesized AgNP-modified β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) using green synthesis for the sensitive and selective zidovudine (ZDV) determination. Characterization of nanoparticles was done using different methods including infrared (IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and also, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The AgNP λ-max peak was at approximately 405 nm. In the presence of ZDV, yellow solution was turned to red color, and surface plasmon absorption band was dramatically centered at 560 nm. ZDV was determined in the range of 50-500 μM, and the detection limit value was obtained as 42 μM. The sensor was used to determine ZDV in tablets with good recovery.">

Herein, we report new ribozymes that use orthogonal substrates, derived from the antiviral drug tenofovir, and attach bioorthogonal functional groups, as well as affinity handles and fluorescent reporter units through a hydrolytically more stable phosphonate ester linkage. The tenofovir transferase ribozymes were identified by in vitro selection and are orthogonal to nucleotide transferase ribozymes. As genetically encodable functional RNAs, these ribozymes may be developed for potential cellular applications. The orthogonal ribozymes addressed desired target sites in large RNAs in vitro, as shown by fluorescent labeling of E. coli 16S and 23S rRNAs in total cellular RNA.">

There are many expediencies provided by the use of hiPSCs, which can represent a disease model clinically relevant and predictive, with a great potential if associated to CRISPR/Cas9 technology, a gene editing tool powered by ease and precision never seen before.Here, we describe the possible applications of CRISPR/Cas9 to hiPSCs: from drug development to drug screening and from gene therapy to the induction of the immunological response to specific virus infection, such as HIV and SARS-Cov-2.">

        <span class="abst" title="At the end of 2019, the entire world has witnessed the birth of a new member of coronavirus family in Wuhan, China. Ever since, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has swiftly invaded every corner on the planet. By the end of April 2020, almost 3.5 million cases have been reported worldwide, with a death toll of about 250000 deaths. It is currently well-recognized that patient’s immune response plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This inflammatory element was evidenced by its elevated mediators that, in severe cases, reach their peak in a cytokine storm. Together with the reported markers of liver injury, such hyperinflammatory state may trigger significant derangements in hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic machinery, and subsequent modulation of drug clearance that may result in unexpected therapeutic/toxic response. We hypothesize that COVID-19 patients are potentially vulnerable to a significant disease-drug interaction, and therefore, suitable dosing guidelines with therapeutic drug monitoring should be implemented to assure optimal clinical outcomes.">

Pharmaceutical re-use, reflecting an effective drug development technique using existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the costs relative to de novo drug discovery. We have performed virtual screening of antiviral compounds targeting the spike glycoprotein (S), main protease (Mpro), and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex of SARS-CoV-2. PC786, an antiviral polymerase inhibitor, showed improved binding affinity toward all the targets. Furthermore, the post-fusion conformation of the trimeric S protein RBD domain with ACE2 revealed conformational changes associated with the PC786 drug binding. The proposed T cell and B cell epitope identification using the immunoinformatics approach could direct the experimental study with a higher probability of discovering appropriate vaccine candidates with fewer experiments and higher reliability.">

In many cases, surgeries are delayed unless they are essential. This is also true with regards to cancer treatments and screening. Interestingly, some existing drugs and nutraceuticals have been screened for their effects on COVID-19. Certain FDA approved drugs, vitamin, natural products and trace minerals may be repurposed to treat or improve the prevention of COVID-19 infections and disease progression.

It is largely unknown how the human immune system responds to this infection. A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be important to develop therapeutics against COVID-19. Here, we have used transcriptomic profile of human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells (A549) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and employed a network biology approach to generate human-virus interactome. Network topological analysis discovers 15 SARS-CoV-2 targets, which belongs to a subset of interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs (IFIT1, IFITM1, IRF7, ISG15, MX1, and OAS2) can be considered as potential candidates for drug targets in the treatments of COVID-19. We have identified significant interaction between ISGs and TLR3 agonists, like poly I: C, and imiquimod, and suggests that TLR3 agonists can be considered as a potential drug for drug repurposing in COVID-19. Our network centric analysis suggests that moderating the innate immune response is a valuable approach to target COVID-19.">

More than 8,700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been recorded worldwide so far, with much more cases popping up overseas than those inside. As the initial epicenter in the world, China has been combating the epidemic for a relatively longer period and accumulated valuable experience in prevention and control of COVID-19. This article reviewed the clinical use, mechanism and efficacy of the clinically approved drugs recommended in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (DTPNCP) released by National Health Commission of P.R.China, and the novel therapeutic agents now undergoing clinical trials approved by China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to evaluate experimental treatment for COVID-19. Reviewing the progress in drug development for the treatment against COVID-19 in China may provide insight into the epidemic control in other countries.">

The first case was identified in a patient with influenza-like symptoms along with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and now it has spread in more than 200 countries. Since there is no approved cure for this disease until now, there is a lot of mass fear, apprehensions, and questions globally regarding (i) genetic origin and history of the novel coronavirus, (ii) what are the first-line therapies for those who contract this disease, and (iii) what could be the potential vaccine targets. In this short review, we have tried to address these queries in the simplest manner and compiled the history of previous coronaviruses, recent developments in the COVID-19 research, potential future therapeutics, and possible targets to cure the disease.">

Despite the knowledge of previous coronaviruses, such as those responsible for the SARS and MERS-CoV epidemic, there is no drug or prophylaxis treatment to this day. The rapid succession of scientific findings on SARS-CoV-2 provides a significant number of potential drug targets. Nevertheless, at the same time, the high quantity of clinical data, generated by a large number of rapidly infected people, require accurate tests regarding effective medical treatments. Several in vitro and in vivo studies were rapidly initiated after the outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19. Initial clinical studies revealed the promising potential of remdesivir that demonstrated a powerful and specific in vitro antiviral activity for COVID-19. Promising effects appear to be attributable to hydroxychloroquine. Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are being tested in ongoing randomized trials. In contrast, oseltamivir was not effective and corticosteroids are not currently recommended. However, few data from ongoing clinical trials are identifying low molecular weight heparins, innate immune system stimulating agents, and inflammatory modulating agents as potential effective agents. The authors assume that the current pandemic will determine the need for a systematic approach based on big data analysis for identifying effective drugs to defeat SARS-Cov-2. This work is aimed to be a general reference point and to provide an overview as comprehensive as possible regarding the main clinical trials in progress at the moment.">

        <span class="abst" title="AIM:SARS-CoV-2 infection has been divided by scientific opinion into three phases: the first as asymptomatic or slightly symptomatic and the second and the third with greater severity, characterized by a hyperinflammatory and fibrotic state, responsible for lung lesions, in some cases fatal. The development of antiviral drugs directed against SARS-CoV-2 and effective vaccines is progressing; meanwhile, the best pharmacological objective is related to the management of all the complications caused by this viral infection, mainly controlling the inflammatory and fibrotic state and preventing the infection from moving into the most serious phases. SUBJECT AND METHOD:Describe the scientific rationale related to the use of an antifibrotic therapy with pirfenidone, as monotherapy and/or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs to manage and control complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS:Based on the scientific literature and epidemiological results and considering the pathophysiological, biological, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, an antifibrotic drug such as pirfenidone as monotherapy or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs can be (acting early, at the right doses and at the right time) therapeutically effective to avoid serious complications during viral infection. The same approach can also be effective as postinfection therapy in patients with residual pulmonary fibrotic damage. Management of inflammation and fibrotic status with a combination therapy of pirfenidone and IL-6 or IL-1 inhibitors could represent a pharmacological synergy with added value. CONCLUSION:In this article, we consider the role of antifibrotic therapy with pirfenidone in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection on going or in the stage of postinfection with pulmonary fibrotic consequences. The scientific rationale for its use is also described.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants are a rich source of new antiviral, pharmacologically active agents. The naturally occurring plant alkaloid berberine (BBR) is one of the phytochemicals with a broad range of biological activity, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. BBR targets different steps in the viral life cycle and is thus a good candidate for use in novel antiviral drugs and therapies. It has been shown that BBR reduces virus replication and targets specific interactions between the virus and its host. BBR intercalates into DNA and inhibits DNA synthesis and reverse transcriptase activity. It inhibits replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This isoquinoline alkaloid has the ability to regulate the MEK-ERK, AMPK/mTOR, and NF-κB signaling pathways, which are necessary for viral replication. Furthermore, it has been reported that BBR supports the host immune response, thus leading to viral clearance. In this short review, we focus on the most recent studies on the antiviral properties of berberine and its derivatives, which might be promising agents to be considered in future studies in the fight against the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.">

Plant-derived essential oils may serve as alternative sources of virus-induced disease therapy. Previous studies have demonstrated essential oils to be excellent candidates to treat antiviral-resistant infection associated with their chemical complexity which confers broad-spectrum mechanisms of action and non-specific antiviral properties. However, almost no comprehensive reviews are updated to generalize knowledge in this regard and disclose the interplay between the components and their antiviral activities. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the antiviral efficacy of essential oils from a wide range of plant species and their characteristic components, as well as their overall mechanisms of action, focusing on the last decade. The roles of individual components relative to the overall antiviral efficacy of essential oils, together with the antiviral activity of essential oils in comparison with commercial drugs are also discussed. Lastly, the inadequacies in current research and future research are put forward. This review will provide references in the design of new drug prototypes and improve our understanding of the proper applications of essential oils in the future.">

In principle, all CoV enzymes and proteins involved in viral replication and the control of host cellular machineries are potentially druggable targets in the search for therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2. This Perspective provides an overview of the main targets from a structural point of view, together with reported therapeutic compounds with activity against SARS-CoV-2 and/or other CoVs. Also, the role of innate immune response to coronavirus infection and the related therapeutic options will be presented.">

        <span class="abst" title="Ethical issues abound during this unprecedented international public health crisis of Covid-19. While the trade-off between societal and individual interests that occurs at the intersection of public health ethics and clinical ethics affects all populations, this calculus has particular relevance for pregnant women and the question of when they will have access to new Covid-19 therapies and vaccines. Pregnant women are a &quot;scientifically complex&quot; population whose inclusion in clinical research must be done with consideration of the unique state of pregnancy. Yet research on the impact of Covid-19 on pregnant women is lagging. In a rush to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is crucial that the interests of pregnant women be prioritized to enable them to make autonomous, informed decisions about participating in clinical trials. The global pandemic calls for a revisiting of frameworks for the inclusion of pregnant women in research, as these women have an important stake in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:A pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection broke out all over the world, however, epidemiological data and viral shedding in pediatric patients are limited. METHODS:We conducted a retrospective, multi-center study, and followed up with all children from the families with SARS-CoV-2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China. All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with RT-PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families was compared. Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan Meier plot. RESULTS:By February 29, 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 314 of which were families with children. Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%). The mean age of 43 pediatric cases was 8.2 years and mean incubation period was 9.1 days. Forty (93.0%) were family clustering. Thirty-three children had COVID-19 (20 pneumonia) with mild symptoms and 10 were asymptomatic. Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was positive in 91.4% (32/35) cases and some children had viral excretion time over 70 days. Viral clearance time was not different among the groups treated with different antiviral regiments. No subsequent infection was observed in family contacts of fecal-viral-excreting children. CONCLUSION:Children have lower susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, longer incubation and fecal viral excretion time. Positive results of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection were not used as indication for hospitalization or quarantine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.">

While studies are mixed on this topic, the therapeutic effect of HCQ or CQ still need more valid clinical evidence. In this descriptive observational study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of HCQ in COVID‐19 infected patients and 30 cases were included. The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C‐reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) before and after HCQ therapy and clinical outcome in the 30 COVID‐19 patients were assessed. In order to evaluate the effect of mediation time point, we also divided these cases into two groups, patients began administrated with HCQ within 7 days hospital (defined as early delivery group) and 7 days after hospital (defined as later delivery group). We found that, the elevated IL‐6, a risk factor in severe patients were reduced to normal level after HCQ treatment. More importantly, patients treated with HCQ at the time of early hospital recovered faster than those who treated later or taken as second line choose for their obvious shorter hospitalization time. In summary, early use of HCQ was better than later use and the effect of IL‐6 and CRP level can not be ruled out.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The outbreak of a novel coronavirus since December 2019, became an emergency of major international concern. As of June 21, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused 8,769,844 confirmed infections with 463,745 fatal cases worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians. In our clinic, we found a rare case that a COVID-19 patient combined with ischemic stroke. CASE PRESENTATION:A 79-year-old man was admitted to the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine due to right limb weakness for 1 day and slight cough for 1 week. At presentation, his oxygen saturation was 94.2% on room air and body temperature was 37.3 °C (99.0 °F) with some moist rales. Neurological examination showed right limb weakness, and the limb muscle strength was grade 4. The left leg and arms were unaffected. In addition, runs of speech were not fluent enough with tongue deviation. Laboratory studies showed lymphopenia and eosinophilic granulocytopenia. Chest CT revealed bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, with a peripheral lung distribution. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from throat swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. This patient was treated with antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs with supportive care until his discharge. Clopidogrel (75 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) were administered orally to treat acute ischemic stroke. After 12 days of treatment, he can walk normally and communicate with near fluent language. CONCLUSION:We report an even more unusual case, a patient who was hospitalized for right limb weakness and was later diagnosed with COVID-19. Here, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused hypoxemia and excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the occurrence and development of ischemic stroke. Once COVID-19 patients show acute ischemic stroke, neurologists should cooperate with infectious disease doctors to help patients.">

Despite the burden of the disease worldwide, still, no licensed vaccine or any specific drug against 2019-nCoV is available. Data from several countries show that few repurposed drugs using existing antiviral drugs have not (so far) been satisfactory and more recently were proven to be even highly toxic. These findings underline an urgent need for preventative and therapeutic interventions designed to target specific aspects of 2019-nCoV. Again the major factor in this urgency is that the process of data acquisition by physical experiment is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Scientific simulations and more in-depth data analysis permit to validate or refute drug repurposing opportunities predicted via target similarity profiling to speed up the development of a new more effective anti-2019-nCoV therapy especially where in vitro and/or in vivo data are not yet available. In addition, several research programs are being developed, aiming at the exploration of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-nCoV. Computational-based technology has given us the tools to explore and identify potentially effective drug and/or vaccine candidates which can effectively shorten the time and reduce the operating cost. The aim of the present review is to address the available information on molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules and define the computational approaches employed in systematic drug repositioning and vaccine development settings for SARS-CoV-2.">

        <span class="abst" title="The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and deaths caused by it all over the world have imposed great concern on the scientific community to develop potential drugs to combat Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). In this regard, lichen metabolites may offer a vast reservoir for the discovery of antiviral drug candidates. Therefore, to find novel compounds against COVID-19, we created a library of 412 lichen compounds and subjected to virtual screening against the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro). All the ligands were virtually screened, and 27 compounds were found to have high affinity with Mpro. These compounds were assessed for drug-likeness analysis where two compounds were found to fit well for redocking studies. Molecular docking, drug-likeness, X-Score, and toxicity analysis resulting in two lichen compounds, Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid with Mpro-inhibiting activity. These compounds were finally subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to compare the dynamics behavior and stability of the Mpro after ligand binding. The binding energy was calculated by MM-PBSA method to determine the intermolecular protein-ligand interactions. Our results showed that two compounds; Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid had the binding free energy of - 42.42 kJ mol/1 and - 57.85 kJ mol/1 respectively as compared to reference X77 (- 91.78 kJ mol/1). We concluded that Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid show considerable structural and pharmacological properties and they can be used as hit compounds to develop potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. These lichen compounds may be a suitable candidate for further experimental analysis.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) offers an opportunity to eliminate hepatitis C virus (HCV) endemic among people who inject drugs (PWID) and people enrolled in opioid agonist therapy (OAT) programs. The objective of this study was to estimate and to compare HCV treatment uptake after the introduction of DAAs among patients receiving OAT in Sweden and Norway. We also aimed to evaluate predictors of DAAs treatment among OAT patients in both countries. METHODS:This observational study was conducted with data from The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and The Norwegian Prescription Database. We studied dispensed medications to calculate HCV treatment among OAT patients from 2014 to 2017 in Sweden and Norway. HCV prevalence was estimated from primary and secondary sources. Dispensations of medicines from different therapeutic areas, which served as proxy for co-morbidities in 2017, were conditionally adjusted for age, gender, and OAT medications. Logistic regression was used to evaluate these parameters. RESULTS:In total 3529 individuals were identified with dispensed OAT in the Swedish cohort and 7739 individuals in the Norwegian cohort. HCV treatment was utilized by 407 persons in Sweden and 920 in Norway during the study period. Annual HCV and DAA treatment uptake increased in both countries. The estimated cumulative HCV treatment uptake at the end of 2017 was 31% in Norway and 28% in Sweden. DAA treatment was associated with increased age (aOR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0-3.2) and the dispensation of drugs used for diabetes (aOR 3.2; 95% CI 1.8-5.7) in Sweden. In Norway, lipid modifying agents and antibacterials were associated with decreased odds (aOR 0.4; 95%CI 0.2-0.9, aOR 0.8; 95%CI 0.6-1.0). CONCLUSIONS:An increase in DAA treatment and HCV treatment uptake was observed among Swedish and Norwegian OAT patients whilst introducing new direct-acting antiviral treatment regimens. However, more than two thirds of the OAT population in Norway and Sweden were untreated at the beginning of 2018. A further scale-up is crucial in order to control and eliminate the HCV endemic among OAT patients.">

The role of nanotechnology is highly relevant to counter this &quot;virus&quot; nano enemy. Nano intervention is discussed in terms of designing effective nanocarriers to counter the conventional limitations of antiviral and biological therapeutics. This strategy directs the safe and effective delivery of available therapeutic options using engineered nanocarriers, blocking the initial interactions of viral spike glycoprotein with host cell surface receptors, and disruption of virion construction. Controlling and eliminating the spread and reoccurrence of this pandemic demands a safe and effective vaccine strategy. Nanocarriers have potential to design risk-free and effective immunization strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine candidates such as protein constructs and nucleic acids. We discuss recent as well as ongoing nanotechnology-based therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to fight against this pandemic, outlining the key areas for nanoscientists to step in.">

As of April 22, over 650 clinical studies have been registered both in USA and internationally. Results from these studies are also coming at a brisk pace in this unprecedented emergency. Areas covered:We searched the NCI website and Medline and summarize various national and international clinical trials and summarize few of the pivotal ones in this paper, including those specific to oncology population. Two hundred and eighty four studies are actively recruiting adults and children with confirmed COVID-19, including 25 are early-phase I/phase I, 72 phase II, 58 phase III, 12 phase IV, and 31 other trials. They can be categorized into four groups: drugs that combat SARS-CoV-2, immunomodulatory agents to counteract cytokine storm, convalescence plasma therapies and vaccines trials. Expert opinion:It is hoped that these efforts will results in a successful treatment to COVID-19, especially in a timely fashion before the second pandemic expected in fall. It is essential to acknowledge the devotion and hard work of the clinical research team and clinical research volunteers.">

        <span class="abst" title="HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs), such as darunavir (DRV), are the key component of antiretroviral therapy. However, HIV-1 often acquires resistance to PIs. Here, seven novel PIs were synthesized, by introducing single atom changes such as an exchange of a sulfur to an oxygen, scission of a single bond in P2'-cyclopropylaminobenzothiazole (or -oxazole), and/or P1-benzene ring with fluorine scan of mono- or bis-fluorine atoms around DRV's scaffold. X-ray structural analyses of the PIs complexed with wild-type Protease (PRWT) and highly-multi-PI-resistance-associated PRDRVRP51 revealed that the PIs better adapt to structural plasticity in PR with resistance-associated amino acid substitutions by formation of optimal sulfur bond and adaptation of cyclopropyl ring in the S2'-subsite. Furthermore, these PIs displayed increased cell permeability and extreme anti-HIV-1 potency compared to DRV. Our work provides the basis for developing novel PIs with high potency against PI-resistant HIV-1 variants with a high genetic barrier.">

        <span class="abst" title="BackgroundThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan. The virus is highly infectious. Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors.Case presentationWe present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus.ConclusionsThe severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients. And the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients is challenged by the immunosuppressive state of these patients under chemotherapy or surgery.">

It has rapidly spread around the globe, which initially began in the city of Wuhan, People’s Republic of China and is hypothesized to originate from the group of Rhinolophus bats. Till date, there has been no clinically proven vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 and thus the doctors are employing the other well-known techniques, which have previously successfully tackled similar other human coronaviruses. To prevent the further spread of COVID-19, doctors are advising isolation of the infected patients, and also regular washing of hands and the use of face mask for the common people. In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the countries are going for nationwide lockdown as the only preventive measure to avert community transmission of this disease, which is having economic, social and psychological effect on the general mass. Therefore, this comprehensive review article encapsulates the biological evolution of human coronaviruses, probable treatment and control strategies to combat COVID-19 and, its impact on human life.">

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ETV and TDF in HBeAg positive CHB patients who had a poor response to Peg-INFα-2b at the end of 12 weeks of monotherapy.Methods: A total of 40 HBeAg-positive CHB patients who were naive to antiviral therapy were recruited. The patients received a subcutaneous injection of Peg-IFNα-2b (180 µg) once a week for 12 weeks. However, the patients had a poor response to Peg-INFα-2b at the end of the 12-week-period monotherapy. The patients were then divided into two therapeutic protocol groups: (1) Group A: Patients received Peg-IFNα-2b (180 µg) subcutaneously weekly and ETV (0.5 mg) orally once daily for 48 weeks; (2) Group B: Patients received Peg-IFNα-2b (180 µg) subcutaneously weekly and TDF (300 mg) orally once daily for 48 weeks. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated. Blood samples were collected at baseline and every 12 weeks. Routine biochemical tests including ALT, AST, etc. were measured by automated biochemical technique. HBV DNA was quantified using the TaqMan PCR assay. The levels of HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb and HBcAb were measured using a commercial chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay.Results: The HBsAg level declined rapidly in both two treatment groups during the first 12 weeks and declined gradually in the next 36 weeks. At week 48, the mean ΔHBsAg level in Peg-IFNα-2b+TDF group was significantly higher than that in Peg-IFNα-2b +ETV group (-1.799 ± 0.3063 vs. -1.078 ± 0.2028, P=0.0491). The HBeAg loss rate was significantly higher in TDF add-on group than that in ETV add-on group at week 48 (40% vs. 10%, P=0.028). At week 48, the proportions of patients with undetectable HBV DNA (&lt;500 IU/mL) were 80% (16 out of 20) and 95% (19 out of 20) in Peg-IFNα-2b+ETV group and Peg-IFNα-2b+TDF group, respectively.Conclusions: This real world study demonstrated that the efficacy of addition of TDF to Peg-IFNα-2b is superior to the efficacy of addition of ETV to Peg-IFNα-2b in HBeAg positive CHB patients with a poor response after 12 weeks of Peg-IFNα-2b treatment alone. However, this present study also requires a larger sample size study to verify in the future.">

This been recently declared as Global Pandemic by WHO. There is a global emergency to identify potential drugs to treat the SARS-CoV-2. Currently, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. There is a urgency to identifying potential antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. An effective and quick approach is to test existing antiviral drugs against. Whole genome analysis and alignment carried out using BLASTn, SMART BLAST and WebDSV 2.0 had shown more than 238 ORF's coding for proteins mostly origin from Bat SARS coronavirus and root genomic origin from Archaea. Molecular docking results against protein targets Furin, papain like proteases, RdRp and Spike glycoprotein had shown paritaprevir, ritonavir, entecavir and chloroquine derivatives are the best drugs to inhibit multi targets of coronavirus infection including natural compounds corosolic acid, baicalin and glycyrrhizic acid with minimal inhibitory concentrations. Thus we propose use of paritaprevir, entecavir, ritonavir and chloroquine derivatives as best drug combination along with niacinamide, folic acid and zinc supplements to treat novel coronavirus infection. We also propose use of plant protease inhibitors (PI's) and Anti-IL8, IL-6, IL-2 as future drug models against coronavirus.">
